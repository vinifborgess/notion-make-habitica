# Cross-Platform Task Integrator using Habitica, Make and Notion
This project shows how to automate tasks across different platforms to improve productivity and management of daily activities.

## Project description
In this repository, you will learn how to use an automation tool to connect Habitica, a gamification platform that encourages the development of healthy habits, with Notion, a powerful organization and productivity solution. By integrating these tools, you will be able to automate the creation of items in a Notion database whenever a new task is added to Habitica.

## Tools:
ðŸ‘¾ Habitica: An app that turns habit formation and task management into a game, offering virtual rewards to help users stay motivated.

ðŸª¢ Make: An automation solution that lets you create custom workflows to automate repetitive processes like database updates or file organization.

ðŸ’­ Notion: A versatile platform that lets you manage notes, tasks, projects, and more in an intuitive, customizable environment.

## Main Goal:
Demonstrate how to create automation flows that connect Habitica to Notion, making it easier to manage tasks between these two tools.
